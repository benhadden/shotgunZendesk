Home Page

The homepage is customized by copy and pasting the contents of homepage.html into the Introducty Text section of the Zendesk home page.

Widgets

All snippets of code in the widgets folder were added as widgets in the Manage > Extensions > Widgets section of Zendesk.

Icons

Any custom icons were first uploaded to Zendesk by creating a new Ticket and adding the icon as an attachement.  Without submitting the Ticket, you can copy the link of the uploaded file for use anywhere on the site.  All icon paths are stored in the icons.css CSS Widget.
